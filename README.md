# password-generator

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this assignment is to give a user a randomly generated password with the given values that it wishes to select. This is to help us build our understanding of arrays as well as objects, and functions. we begin with entering out variables for the array to have some values to create the password so we have some sort of "pot" full of random characters. We then make some empty arrays of what we would start with, in this case there should be nothing since we want the password generator to be randomized and not have any initial values. We then create a prompt asking the user how long the password they wish it to be, if its < 8 || > 128 then we tell the user this is outside of the minimum or maximum value of the password. We than add some confirmation on what the password should contain such as lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. We then create an if statement stating if the user selects none of the values then it will not generate a password and asking them to at least select two variables. After all that we create a for loop that continues to spit out a random characer based on the specifications of the users input and create a random password. After all that we create a textarea where the password can be easliy seen and create a clipboard.
